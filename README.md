# The Bountiful Hoard

A small Vue.js app that allows you to search for ruby gems and save your favorites, inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone this repo

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start the development server

```
npm run dev
```

## Usage

To extend the metaphor of the app perhaps beyond its breaking point:

* you find gems by _searching the wilds_, which you may then _covet_ in your _hoard_
* you may _discard_ any unwanted gems from your _hoard_
* you may expand and collapse your _hoard_ to show or hide gems

## Notes

* The typography scales to the viewport, so it looks good across almost all screen sizes
* All of the `.vue` components have tests
* Parcel is very interesting!
